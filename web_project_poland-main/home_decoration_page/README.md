Home Decoration E-Commerce Platform 🏡🛒
Tech Stack: Vue.js | Node.js | Express.js | Sequelize | MySQL

I developed a full-stack Home Decoration E-Commerce Platform that enables users to browse, rate, and purchase home decor products. The platform supports client, admin, and guest login accounts, each with distinct functionalities.

The frontend is built using Vue.js, ensuring a seamless user experience, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with Sequelize ORM handling database operations. The system incorporates JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and a structured database.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ User Authentication & Role-Based Access – Secure JWT authentication for clients, admins, and guests
✅ Product Management – Full CRUD operations for adding, updating, and deleting products
✅ Rating & Reviews – Users can rate products and view real-time average ratings
✅ Shopping Cart System – Seamless add/remove functionality with checkout integration
✅ Admin Dashboard – Manage products, users, and orders efficiently
✅ RESTful API Integration – Well-structured API endpoints for smooth frontend-backend communication

This project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, API design, database management, and frontend development using Vue.js.
